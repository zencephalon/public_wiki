%title my brain on zen

Hi, I'm [[Matthew Bunday]]. I'm interested in how we experience consciousness and the world around us, how mathematics seems to be the ‘source code’ of the universe, how we can work together to design efficient systems, and how language interacts with thought.

I offer consulting services in programming, writing, and [[meditation]]. I'm also willing to teach anything I know.

I write [[Fiction|fiction]] and [[Poems|poetry]]. I [[advice-for-myself|write to myself]]. And I love to [[playground|play with ideas]].

Here are some miscellaneous articles:
* [[Guiding Principles]]
* [[Becoming Myself]]
* [[The Power of a Rubber Band]]
* [[Quit Masturbating]]
* [[thoughts-on-martial-arts|Thoughts on Martial Arts]]
* [[lessons-in-living|Lessons in Living]]
* [[time-travel-instruction-set|Time Travel Instruction Set]]
* [[ode-to-tragedy|Ode to Tragedy]]
* [[be-happy-for-no-reason|Be Happy for No Reason]]
* [[you-havent-yet|You Haven't Yet]]
* [[Dialogue with Death]]
* [[Break Laws (and Tell People!)]]
