%title Commentary on Separation

_Separation_ is one of my best early works. It began as an experiment in writing a story using only dialogue in the early drafts. It still has that feel to it, but in the interest of pragmatism some description was inserted. If it feels like several stories in one, that's because it is. I really like the story-within-the-story. At the time I wrote this I was very much a hopeless romantic, thus I poured a lot of myself into this. As hinted at in the story itself, the writing process was therapeutic for me, and helped me overcome a few unrequited loves that I was nursing. I'm quite fond of this story overall, and I think it reflects the many weeks I labored over it. The writing process was fairly frustrating, I tried six different permutations of verb tense and narrative perspective before I settled on the current outcome. This was my first attempt at writing in present tense, and I rather liked it. It is my first story to feature the idea of self-fulfilling prophecy, a theme that has become increasingly prominent in my writing.
