Placebo is the sexy scientist god of humorous healing.

Placebo appeared to me in the form of a strikingly well built bearded viking in a white lab coat.

Of all the gods he has the most evidence supporting his existence. Not only that, but there is ample scientific evidence of his healing powers.

Laughter is the best medicine. But Placebo wants us to know that orgasm is also the best medicine. And best of all is laughter during an orgasm.
