%title The Great Rite

A young writer and magickian decides one day to perform The Great Rite. He has understood the mystical doctrine “as above, so below”. Let’s call the writer Above. Above writes a spellbook in which Below writes a spellbook, then performs The Great Rite. The Rite causes Below and Above to switch places, so that everything that happens to Above in Below’s spellbook happens to Below. Then Above performs The Great Rite, causing Above and Below to switch places, so that everything that happens to Below in Above’s spellbook happens to Above.

Above is surprised as everything starts happening according to the spellbook he has written. Is he getting more than he bargained for? Or did he not write ambitiously enough? As his written dreams start coming true he wonders if it will continue, or if it was just a fluke, and why something doesn’t feel entirely satisfactory about this,.
