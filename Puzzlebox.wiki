{{{
what is this heart
I keep unfolding it
to find yet another
origami puzzle of delight
does it ever end
inside this strange box
I have found locks
do you have a key
is there a treasure inside
or is the box itself the prize
I was given this gift
by my mother and father
have they solved the puzzle
or did it keep going
why does it keep changing
I'm puzzled by love
and I wouldn't have it
any other way
