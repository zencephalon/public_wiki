%title Commentary on “A Stone’s Fall”

_A Stone’s Fall_ is another early work. I was inspired by Alan Moore's _Watchmen_ to try embedding textual documents within the story to advance the plot. This was written during a dark time in my life, perhaps the second darkest overall, and it certainly reflects a lot of angst that I felt in high school. In retrospect my high school experience was fantastic, but I couldn't see it for what it was at the time. I had originally just intended to write a fantasy story about a living gargoyle, a trope I found fascinating, but the concept kept changing as I was writing it. I couldn't bear to write a story that didn't mean something more to me. I wrote several drafts of this from Thomas's perspective, which I may revisit. The main reason I abandoned those drafts was that seeing through his eyes was too depressing. Now as a more mature author I may be able to handle it.
