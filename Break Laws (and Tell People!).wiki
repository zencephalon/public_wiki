%title Break Laws (and Tell People!)

In a more ideal world, the US Government would be dedicated to reviewing existing laws for effectiveness and repealing ineffective laws on its own. In this world, if we want laws repealed, then we have to talk about how we’ve broken them.

For the record, I have broken: the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Controlled_Substances_Act|Controlled Substances Act]], the [[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Analog_Act|Federal Analog Act]].

Although I have never been convicted of a crime I have ‘ab-used’ (apparently according to the US Government there is no way to ‘use’ marijuana in a way that isn’t abnormal, or simply possessing it wouldn’t be a crime) a multitude of controlled substances.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marijuana|Marijuana]]: bought, used to great effect in enhancing pleasurable activities, sold.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDMA|MDMA]]: bought, used.

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/LSD|LSD]]: bought, used to great effect in self-therapy, sold.

[[Psilocybin]]: bought, used to great effect in self-therapy, sold, grew (this is very easy to do, I encourage you to [[http://www.shroomery.org/|try it yourself]]!).

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/25C-NBOMe#United_States|25C-NBOMe]]: used to the temporary detriment of my sanity (thought it was LSD, got sloppy and didn’t test it; let this be a warning to you; of course the mistake would not have happened if legally registered LSD manufacturers were allowed to exist).

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mephedrone|Mephedrone]]: bought, used (this is terrible; MDMA ought to be legal if only so that no one would ever seriously consider mephedrone again).

[[http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDAI|MDAI]]: bought, used.

This is how I’ve decided I will react to the US Government’s ever encroaching surveillance. If they want to know everything about me, then fine. But it’s only fair that my fellow Americans also know everything about me. This is the transparent course of action.
